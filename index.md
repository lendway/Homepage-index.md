Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University studying inequality, populism, and social movements. 


My research has been published in Environmental Politics and the Yale Journal of International Affairs, and I have presented my research at a wide range of organizations, including the American Political Science Association,  Harvard University, and Yale University. My research has been funded by the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and other organizations.

I completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration with a Finance major at William and Mary as well as a Master's of Public Administration at the University of Pennsylvania. Before starting the PhD program at Yale, I completed a Leadership Development Program at a Fortune 500 healthcare company called Amerigroup, which is now part of Elevance Health. I also served as the Faculty of Health Sciences Program Coordinator and Office of Undergraduate Studies Business Manager at Virginia Teach.
