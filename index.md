Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. The primary goal of my research agenda is to better understand the social-psychology of political preference formation in American politics. To this end, my research agenda consists of two primary streams of research. (1) I explore at how elite rhetoric affects political preferences. In particular, my dissertation research develops and tests a theory for how elite populist appeals increase mass support for democratic erosion. (2) I study how information shapes political preferences. This includes my prior research on how structural fairness arguments affect inequality preferences and how exposure to information about divestment affects climate policy preferences. This research agenda employes a mixed-methods approach, including machine learning, survey experiments, observational data analysis, qualitative content analysis. I collaborate with a broad range of scholars at universities across the country.

My research is published or forthcoming in American Politics Research, Environmental Politics and the Yale Journal of International Affairs. I have presented my research at a wide range of organizations, including the American Political Science Association,  Harvard University, and Yale University. Funding for my research has been provided by the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and other organizations.

I completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration with a Finance major at William and Mary as well as a Master's of Public Administration at the University of Pennsylvania. Before starting the PhD program at Yale, I completed a Leadership Development Program at a Fortune 500 healthcare company called Amerigroup, which is now part of Elevance Health. I also served as the Faculty of Health Sciences Program Coordinator and Office of Undergraduate Studies Business Manager at Virginia Teach.
